Hi Everyone,

Hope you're all well and enjoying the lovely weather.

I thought about combining Neural Networks 1 and 2 lecture for this study group update. There's a lot to catch up on, but I found a lot of it to be incredibly fascinating.

## Week 5 and 6 Catchup:
* [History of Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fXNiJXUheI)

* [McCulloch & Pitts Neuron simulator](https://justinmeiners.github.io/neural-nets-sim/)

* [McCulloch & Pitts neuron original paper (for those deeeeeply interested)](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/mcp.pdf)

* [Single Layer/Multi Layer Perceptrons](https://computing.dcu.ie/~humphrys/Notes/Neural/single.neural.html)

* [Error (or Loss) function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVVVjBSk9N0)

* [(Stochastic) Gradient Descent Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhqo0u1a6fw)

* [Application to Neural Networks](https://www.mladdict.com/neural-network-simulator)

* [This is a really excellent video (and channel) on neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)

## Event

It's the UCL Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit's 21st birthday and they're spending the day with a fascinating range of talks. Gatsby is a world-famous centre that is at the heart of AI research. Moreover, Google's DeepMind was founded by some of their PhD graduates.

## Finally... Today is a special day

23 June is the late and great Alan Turing's birthday, he would have been 107 years old. Turing is most notable for his pioneering work in computing and artificial intelligence. Here's the audio recording of a lecture from the Royal Society titled, ['Alan Turing: Not Just A Beautiful Mind'](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2012/alan-turing/).

See you all next week!

Kind regards,

Alex
