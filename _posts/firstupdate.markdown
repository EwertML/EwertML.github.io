Hey everyone,

We're just getting ready up for our first week studying Machine Learning at Ewert House. I hope everyone is as excited as I am.

Currently, I'm glued to the ML talks at Google IO. But fear not, I will be preparing a brief manifesto for what we hope to achieve with Ewert Machine Learning. Yes, this is a study group. But I hope this will be a launch pad for something much more. For example, humans tend to achieve greater goals when they talk together, hence why we have conferences and summits. I hope Ewert ML will embrace collaboration between collegues, embarking on shared projects, competitions, talks, discussions, and journal/reading clubs.

Super excited, but this is just the beginning. 

See you this weekend.

Alex
