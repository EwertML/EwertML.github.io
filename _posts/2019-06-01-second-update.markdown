Hi everyone,

I hope you are all doing well. Here's the 2nd update to our study group. Please feel free to reply with your thoughts.

## Week 4 catchup
* [Chebyshev's Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMgK000XFhA)
* [Central Limit Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNm3M9cqWyc)
* [Expectation Maximisation (EM) Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQoXFmbXRJA)
* [Full Notes](https://github.com/ionescu/Machine_Learning_2019/blob/master/04-Unsupervised_Learning/04-Unsupervised_Learning.md)

## Week 4 Exercise
Consider a card game played with a full deck, in which aces have a value of 11, jacks 12, queens 13, kings 14, and all other cards a value of 0. We draw a card at random from the deck. What is its expected value? Define Î©, Event, p and the random variable whose expected value you are computing.

Let's have a crack at this together?

## Engaging in the study group
The general feedback I received was that people would prefer to engage within the study group by means of email, whatsapp, other social media, etc. Therefore, I moved everyone to the CC list rather than BCC so you can now reply and create email threads. I made a blog/twitter for those who are on twitter. As for the Whatsapp group, if someone would like to set one up for me (I'm unfamiliar with Whatsapp), that would be great too.

## Events
June 10 Mon-Wed (CogX19) takes place in London. You may be interested this as it's a festival of AI and emerging technology! I'm volunteering there for the morning shifts, so if you're in, do say hi! More info: https://cogx.co/

Don't worry about the price of the tickets. The organisers, exhibitors, and speakers are giving away free tickets if you search around Twitter for public promotions. Here's a few I found:
1. https://ti.to/cogx/2019/discount/345w345ilhjkio3kjqh5l4k_FRIENDINVITE
2. https://ti.to/cogx/2019/discount/CX19WOWEXPO

## And finally.... A bit of fun from week 3
For all intents and purposes, a bayesian network to compute the probability of Dr. Ionescu cycling in a good mood and noticing Alex in the market. I may have made a mistake, so please use this opportunity to correct me and suggest improvements to the model!

See you all next week,

Alex
